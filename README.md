# üìù Browser-Only Sticky Note Application

## Project Overview

This is a **front-end-only web application** for creating and managing time-aware to-do items. It is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The core of this project demonstrates client-side data management by using the browser's native **`localStorage`** API to ensure all tasks are **persisted** (saved) and remain available even after the user closes and re-opens the browser.

## üü¢ Project Status

The application is **stable** and fully implements the **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Automated **End-to-End (E2E) testing** is integrated using Selenium WebDriver.

## üí° Key Learning Outcomes

Building this project with an AI agent was a major achievement. The primary takeaways include:

* **Full CRUD Implementation:** Gained hands-on experience implementing all four essential database operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using `localStorage` for data handling.
* **Front-End Data Persistence (`localStorage`):** Learned how to use the browser's native storage to save and load the full application state (`setItem()` and `getItem()`), allowing the app to survive a page refresh.
* **Git Workflows with AI Agents:** Adopted the best practice of using a dedicated **Git Worktree** (isolated sandbox) when running the Claude Code agent to prevent accidental changes to the main repository.
* **Vanilla JavaScript DOM Manipulation:** Gained experience writing pure JavaScript to dynamically manipulate the HTML structure (DOM nodes) for rendering, editing, and removing task elements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Data Persistence:** `localStorage` API
* **Testing:** **Selenium WebDriver** (Integrated for automated End-to-End testing)
* **Development Tooling:** Claude Code (AI Agentic Tool)

## ‚ú® Features

* **Persistence:** All notes are automatically saved and loaded from the browser's local storage.
* **Full CRUD Support:** Users can **Create**, **Read**, **Update** (Edit by clicking the task text), and **Delete** tasks.
* **Natural Language Date Parsing:** Type phrases like "tomorrow morning", "Friday at 3pm", "in 2 hours", or "next week" in your task, and the app automatically extracts and sets the due date.
* **Priority Levels:** Assign High, Medium, or Low priority to tasks with color-coded visual indicators (flag icons and colored left borders).
* **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Click and drag task cards to reorder them by importance.
* **Tab Filtering:** View all tasks, or filter by "Today" (due today + overdue) or "Upcoming" (next 7 days).
* **Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and forest green dark theme with persistent preference.
* **Time-Aware Warnings:** Tasks automatically show a visual warning (blinking countdown, red highlight) when they become urgent (‚â§5 minutes remaining).
* **Real-Time Countdowns:** Live countdown timers show exactly how much time remains until each task is due.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with CSS for readability on various devices.

## ‚úÖ Automated Testing (End-to-End)

This project includes **33 automated tests** built with **Selenium WebDriver** to validate core functionality including:
* Basic CRUD operations
* Todo completion and deletion
* Due date and countdown timers
* LocalStorage persistence
* Priority levels
* Edit functionality
* Drag-and-drop reordering
* Natural language date parsing

### How to Run Tests

1.  Ensure you have your Selenium dependencies installed (e.g., via `npm install` if using a Node/JS test runner).
2.  Open the application locally by double-clicking `index.html`.
3.  Run the test suite from your project's terminal:
    ```bash
    # (Use the actual command for your setup, e.g.)
    npm run test:e2e
    ```

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

Since this is a client-side application, you do not need a separate server to run it.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_URL_HERE]
    cd Sticky-Notes-App
    ```
2.  **Launch in Browser:** Double-click the **`index.html`** file in your project root to open the application in any web browser.

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Natural Language Date Entry

Simply type your task with date/time phrases, and the app automatically extracts the due date:

* **"Pick up dry cleaning tomorrow morning"** ‚Üí Task: "Pick up dry cleaning" | Due: Tomorrow at 8:00 AM
* **"Team meeting Friday at 3pm"** ‚Üí Task: "Team meeting" | Due: Next Friday at 3:00 PM
* **"Call client in 2 hours"** ‚Üí Task: "Call client" | Due: 2 hours from now
* **"Review documents next week"** ‚Üí Task: "Review documents" | Due: 7 days from now at 9:00 AM
* **"Lunch meeting today at noon"** ‚Üí Task: "Lunch meeting" | Due: Today at 12:00 PM

### Supported Date/Time Phrases

**Relative Dates:**
* today, tomorrow, tonight
* Day names (Monday, Tuesday, etc.)
* next week
* in X hours, in X days

**Time Expressions:**
* morning (8am), afternoon (2pm), evening (6pm), night (9pm)
* at noon, at midnight
* 3pm, 3:30pm, at 3pm, at 3:30pm
