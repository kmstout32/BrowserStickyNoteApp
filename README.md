# üìù Browser-Only Sticky Note Application

## Project Overview

This is a **front-end-only web application** for creating and managing simple to-do items, built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The key feature of this project is its use of the browser's native **`localStorage`** API to ensure data persistence. This means that any notes created will remain saved even after the user closes and re-opens the browser tab, demonstrating an understanding of client-side data management without needing a back-end server or database.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Data Persistence:** `localStorage` API
* **Development Tooling:** Claude Code (AI Agentic Tool)

## ‚ú® Features

* **Persistence:** All notes are automatically saved and loaded from the browser's local storage.
* **CRUD Operations:** Users can Create, Read, and Delete (Destroy) notes.
* **Responsive Design:** Styled with CSS for readability.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally (No Server Needed!)

Since this is a client-side application, you do not need to run a web server (like Node.js or Python).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_URL_HERE]
    cd [YOUR_REPO_NAME]
    ```
2.  **Open the file:** Locate the `index.html` file in your project folder.
3.  **Launch in Browser:** Double-click `index.html` to open the application directly in your web browser.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Workflow (AI-Assisted)

This project was initially scaffolded and developed using **Claude Code**, an agentic CLI tool.

| Task | Prompt Used |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Scaffolding** | `Create a single-page To-Do List application using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It MUST use the browser's localStorage API to persist data.` |
| **Initial Commit** | Automatically generated file structure. |
| **Planned Next Step** | Implement editing (Update) functionality for existing notes. |

### Step 2: Commit and Push the `README.md`

Now that your `README.md` is complete, save the file and commit it to your repository.

1.  **Stage the file:**
    ```powershell
    git add README.md
    ```

2.  **Commit the file:**
    ```powershell
    git commit -m "docs: Add comprehensive README and setup instructions"
    ```

3.  **Push the changes to GitHub:**
    ```powershell
